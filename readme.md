## Why Pokémon Sword and Shield are "bad" games
[*Pokémon Sword and Shield*](https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/) are 2019 role-playing games published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch system. Alongside the core Pokémon gameplay, the games introduced several new features, notably Dynamax and Gigantamax. However, these features were not universally liked, and the games have received a fair share of criticism and in the 2 years since their release.  
### Dynamax and Gigantamax

The two generations prior to the games release, generations 6 and 7, introduced mega pokemon and z-moves respectively, which were both ways in which players could power up one specific pokemon per battle. Sword and Shield continued this trend by introducing Dynamax, which allowed players to choose any 1 of their pokémon per battle to power up for 3 turns, doubling their HP and changing all their moves to more powerful "max" moves. They also introduced Gigantamax, which is a special version of Dynamax given to a few pokemon, where instead of Dynamaxing, the pokemon will change into a special Gigantamax form, with a different appearance and one of their max moves being substituted with a special0 "G-max" mov
