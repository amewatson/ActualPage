## Why Pokémon Sword and Shield are "bad" games
[*Pokémon Sword and Shield*](https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/) are 2019 role-playing games published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch system. Alongside the core Pokémon gameplay, the games introduced several new features, notably Dynamax and Gigantamax. However, these features were not universally liked, and the games have received a fair share of criticism and in the 2 years since their release.  To be clear, I personally enjoyed these games, but there was a significant portion of the fanbase who did not.
### Dynamax and Gigantamax

The two generations prior to the games release, generations 6 and 7, introduced mega pokemon and z-moves respectively, which were both ways in which players could power up one specific pokemon per battle. Sword and Shield continued this trend by introducing Dynamax, which allowed players to choose any 1 of their pokémon per battle to power up for 3 turns, doubling their HP and changing all their moves to more powerful "max" moves. They also introduced Gigantamax, which is a special version of Dynamax given to a few pokemon, where instead of Dynamaxing, the pokemon will change into a special Gigantamax form, with a different appearance and one of their max moves being substituted with a special "G-max" move.

Critics have claimed that Dynamax lacks originality compared to megas and z-moves, as the pokemon model was blown up to be larger, and the pokemon was largely the same, except that had twice as much HP, and every pokemon shared the same pool of 19 max moves. They cited the mega evolutions released in generation 6 as much more inspired, as every pokemon who received a mega got 100 more base stats, a completely new design, new typing, and a new ability. Fans also cited competitive balance as a key issue, complaining that the mechanic was overpowered and unbalanced. This went as far as Smogon, a major figure in the competitive single battles scene, [banned dynamax in any OU format battles](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/dynamax-is-banned-from-ou-explanation-information.3657917/) on its site, [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/). 

Proponents of this feature claimed that it was an upgrade of both megas and z-moves, saying it was the best of both worlds. Dynamax (and Gigantamax) featured a form change for 1 pokemon per battle, similar to megas, and also allowed them to use stronger, more powerful moves for a limited time, like z-moves. They also praised Gigantamax, as it mixed the idea of giving specific pokemon a new form presented with megas, and also gave specific pokemon special unique powered-up moves, an idea common in z-moves. They also thought that the fact that any pokemon could dynamax was a very large benefit, as players were no longer limited to the specific pokemon with a mega, and who were holding a mega stone or z crystal. This, they said, promoted deeper thought, and a deeper layer of strategy regarding which pokemon to dynamax per battle.

### Multiplayer

Pokémon is a series with many fans, and there should be a method for players all around the world to connect with each other. In these games, that comes in the form of the "y-comm" a special menu that can be opened via pressing the y menu and includes tabs for trading, battles, and more (see above). In order to connect to the greater internet, players must first own a "nintendo switch online" membership, which is a paid subscription to access the internet. They must then press the plus button to connect to the internet, using local networks otherwise. This system has been called unintuitive and was criticized for it being behind a paywall, when internet was allowed to connect for free on the previous 3DS systems. 

However, the complaints regarding mutliplayer did not end there. These games introduced two other methods of multiplayer connection, namely Max Raid battles and pokémon camping. Neither of these options appeared as one of the buttons on the side of the y-comm menu, and you simply had to hope they would show up in the feed of your y-comm, as friends were not guaranteed to appear on the feed. Even after connecting to the internet, there is no way to directly connect with friends. The best way to ensure that you get a connection with a friend through the game would be by entering a link code, which is a 4-digit and later 8-digit number that if two players enter the same code, they can connect with one another. However, this only operates perfectly under the premise that no other individuals other than the two who wish to connect are using that same code. If any other person is using the same code, you might connect with that stranger rather than the friend you wished to connect to. This was seen as deevolution from the previous games, as the generation 6 games provided a feature where you could tap on one of your Nintendo account friends who also played the game and quickly establish a connection. 

### National dex and Graphics
The complaints with these games were not limited to gameplay aspects alone. In fact, there was a storm of hatred leveled at the Pokémon company before the games even released. During E3 2019, Nintendo announced during its [Nintendo treehouse live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmWu-f6L0Mo) that the entire national dex, which comprises of every pokémon Nintendo has released all the way from Pokémon Red and Blue in 1996 until the present day. Nintendo claimed this was due to a lack of resources and time, as they claimed to have redone the animations for every pokemon that was featured in the games. Many fans were disappointed at this news, as they feared they may not be able to use their favorite pokemon in this latest addition to the series. However, Pokemon has gradually been increasing the availability of Pokémon in the game, as they released waves of DLC, or downloadable content. 

The other major complaint leveled at the games before their release was in regards to the graphics, as a now-iconic image of a tree was released before the games' release.
Many fans complained that the Pokemon company claimed to be making improvements graphically, but that the trees looks terrible. Fans compared this image of a tree with trees from *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*, a twenty year old game.
